<p class=title1>A project exploring the effect on pay on investment banks' performance</p>

<container class="sectionA">

 <div class="text-level-A"> Introduction </div>

 <div class="text-level-B"> <p>One of the most fundemental questions any employer must ask is how much to pay an employee. 
   Microeconomic theory would suggest that employees must be paid just above their no-shirking level: the point where the wage 
   is high enough that losing one's job would be more costly than exerting effort. In practice, this is an impossible number to 
   reach, and in any case the model is too simplistic. </p>

   <p>Careers in the City are no exception to this, and have long been renowned for paying large amounts. With the on-going war on talent,
   as well as burnout during the panemic, banks have further raised their salaries (in the region of 30%) this year for all their junior roles. But does this 
   provide value for money? This project aims to establish a link between the pay for junior roles in investment banks with their performance,
   measured by the fees the bank brings in each year. </p>

  
   <p>Unfortunately, banks do not actively publish their annual fees and how much they pay their employees. Furthermore, data providors, such as Refinitiv,
  which publish APIs containing this information, charge thousands each yaer for access. This project therefore scrapes free resources
  avalaible to anyone in the public to try establish a link. Please note: this project does not aim to establish causality - 
  the performance of banks is such a complicated field - but merely tries to establish a link. </p>

  <div class="text-level-A"> Section 1: What are the major global investment banks </div>

  <div class="text-level-B">This first chart shows the performance of the top 10 investment banks globally, based on total fee value. 
    This graph outlines the major players in the space - it is these banks whose pay will be compared to their performance. 
    The data is from the FT, scraped from their website. Sadly the FT only publishes the top 10 banks, 
    but it is a free resource which can be updated very quickly. The scraper can be found <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Dj3RkMDs8wl5iAcQP9PeOScIGM61p5K_?usp=sharing target="_blank" style="color:white">here.</a>

<div class="text-level-A"> Section 2: Pay landscape for Investment Bankers in London </div>

  <div class="text-level-B">Arkesden is a head hunter, based in London, which recruits for Private Equity, Real Estate, Alternatives, Energy and (crucially), Investment Banking. 
    Each year they produce a free-to-download PDF report summarising pay in each sector. 
    A scraper has been built to scrape this PDF, meaning that each year when the report is published, the charts can be updated. 
    <p>The latest PDF (2020-2021) does not reflect the recent increase in base salary, but the scraper has been designed to 
    be fully automated, meaning when the latest report comes out updating the data will be a quick process. The link for the scraper is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gvyMhGYsEuG0Nz7rn6sJQ6BvTqt8IK_q?usp=sharing target="_blank" style="color:white">here.</a>

<!--Chart 15 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart15">
  <script>
    var myChart15 = "charts/BankPay.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart15', myChart15);
  </script>
</div>

<!--Chart 16 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart16">
  <script>
    var myChart16 = "charts/PositionPay.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart16', myChart16);
  </script>
</div>

<div class="text-level-B"> The two charts above summarise base pay (excluding bonuses, which often make up a sizable proportion
  of a bankers' salary). From immediate inspection, it is clear
  that Bank of Merrill Lynch (BAML) pays more than other banks, especially at the Analyst rank (the lowest level), and 
  we will test if this translates to greater performance.</div>

<!--Chart 17 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart17">
  <script>
    var myChart17 = "charts/BankTotalComp.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart17', myChart17);
  </script>
</div>


<div class="text-level-B"> The chart above shows the total compensation, including both base pay and bonus pay. Bonus is
  a function of the performance of the individual (what we are testing) and performance of the bank, an example of reverse causality,
  hence why this project is not aiming to infer causality. The data from the chart was again scraped from Arkesden and can be 
  replicated <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xYs3wGOMoyUAM0xy5N4-e0zn0kVu_6gC?usp=sharing target="_blank" style="color:white">here.</a>

<container class="sectionB">

<div class="text-level-A"> Section 3: Comparing compensation to bank performance </div>

<div class="text-level-B"> This section combines the previous two, and places pay against performance in a scatter plot. 
  <p>There were quite a few challenges to overcome in making these charts, such as two of the top 10 banks not having 
    pay data, and one bank with pay data not being in the FT scraper. Furthermore, the FT names the banks differently
    to Arkesden meaning all banks had to be renamed.</p>
    In future, one will have to manually check all banks 
    with pay data are listed in the FT table, and vice versa for when the two datasets are merged. However, the rest of the 
    python file is automated and should be easily updatable each time a new report is published. The data in the charts can be 
  replicated UPDATE LINK <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xYs3wGOMoyUAM0xy5N4-e0zn0kVu_6gC?usp=sharing target="_blank" style="color:white">here.</a>

  <div class="text-level-A"> Section 4: Regressing bank performance on compensation </div>

  <div class="text-level-B"><p> This section regresses the charts in section 3. We cannot regress all ranks together, 
    because comparing Analyst 1 pay from one bank cannot be compared to VP (Vice President) 3 pay in another bank. 
    Sadly, past FT league tables are not avalaible which would add more datapoints, but the python code saves this data 
    as a new file with today's date each time it is run, meaning that should this code be run each year, it will continue to save 
    historical data. 
  </p>
      Ideally, this chart would be made using a Vega trelllis, but I could not get the trellis to run all the 
      regressions individually, so this section is made of smaller charts combined in a div. The data in the charts can be 
    replicated UPDATE LINK <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xYs3wGOMoyUAM0xy5N4-e0zn0kVu_6gC?usp=sharing target="_blank" style="color:white">here.</a>
