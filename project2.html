<p class=title1>A project exploring the effect on pay on investment banks' performance</p>

<container class="sectionA">

 <div class="text-level-A"> Introduction </div>

 <div class="text-level-B"> One of the most fundamental questions any employer must ask is how much to pay an employee. Careers in the 
   City are no exception, despite been renowned for its large salaries. Banks further raised these salaries (c.30%) last year to cope 
   with burnout and the war for talent. But does this provide value for money? This project aims to establish a link between pay for 
   bankers and their performance, measured by the fees the bank brings in each year. My initial expectation is that of a negative 
   correlation: lower-performing banks to need to pay a higher salary to attract talent, where better performing banks can leverage 
   their prestige.

  
   <p>Unfortunately, banks do not actively publish their annual fees and employee salaries. Furthermore, data providers, 
     such as Refinitiv, which publish APIs containing this information, charge thousands each year for access. This project's 
     primary aim is therefore to use free resources to provide this data and perform some basic analysis. Please note: at no 
     point does this project attempt to establish causality – merely tries to establish a link. </p>

  <div class="text-level-A"> Section 1: What are the major global investment banks </div>

  <div class="text-level-B">This first chart outlines the major players in the space. The data is from the FT, 
    scraped from their website. The FT only publishes the top 10 banks (not the top 30), but it is a free 
    resource which can be updated very quickly. Whilst they do produce the previous year’s tables, these are nested in a dynamic 
    table which cannot easily be scraped. The chart’s data can be replicated

<div class="text-level-A"> Section 2: Pay landscape for Investment Bankers in London </div>

  <div class="text-level-B">Arkesden is a headhunter, based in London, which produces an annual, free-to-download, 
    PDF report summarising investment banking pay. Press  
    <a href="https://www.arkesden.com/asset/8424/download?1619082748 target="_blank" style="color:white">here</a> 
    for the latest report.
    A PDF scraper has been built, downloading the data in seconds. Camelot (the Python library) needed significant 
    adjustments for edge and row tolerance, 
    but the final product should collect all data in any new report.
    <p>The latest PDF (2020-2021) does not reflect the recent increase in base salary. 
      The link for the scraper is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gvyMhGYsEuG0Nz7rn6sJQ6BvTqt8IK_q?usp=sharing target="_blank" style="color:white">here.</a>

  bankers' salary). </div>

<div class="text-level-B"> The chart above shows the total compensation (base + bonus pay). Bonus is a function of the performance of 
  the individual (what we are testing) and performance of the bank, an example of reverse causality, hence why this project is not aiming 
  to infer causality. The data from the chart was again scraped from Arkesden and can be replicated

<div class="text-level-A"> Section 3: Comparing compensation to bank performance </div>

<div class="text-level-B"> This section combines the previous two, and places pay against performance in a scatter plot. 
  <p>There were quite a few challenges to overcome in making these charts, such as not all FT banks having pay data, and vice versa.</p>
  In future, one will have to manually check all banks with pay data are listed in the FT table, and vice versa for when the two 
  datasets are merged. However, the rest of the python file is automated and can be refreshed when new report is published. The data 
  in the charts can be replicated

  <div class="text-level-A"> Section 4: Regressing bank performance on compensation </div>

  <div class="text-level-B"><p> This section regresses the charts in section 3. We cannot regress all ranks together, because one cannot 
    compare Analyst 1 pay to VP 3 pay in the same regression. With the scraper auto-saving backups, each year we would get more 
    datapoints improving the reliability of our regression.

  Ideally, this chart would be made using a Vega trellis, but I could not get the trellis to run all the regressions 
  individually. The data in the charts can be replicated

<div class="text-level-B"><p> As expected, there is a strong correlation between total compensation and bank performance. This is 
  because bank bonuses tend to be a function of the performance of the bank. However, the relationship is striking, with an R2>0.4 
  in half the regressions. </p>
  <p>Unsurprisingly, the R2 is much lower when considering just base pay. However, there is still an upward trend, suggesting that 
    there is some correlation between base pay and performance. Contrary to my initial expectation: banks which pay more have, on 
    average, better performance.

    <div class="text-level-A"> Conclusion </div>

    <div class="text-level-B"><p> Overall, many of the project's aims have been met. We have established a positive correlation between 
      pay and performance. Furthermore, data (in a space which is highly protected by paywalls) has been uncovered, collection automated, 
      and used in analysis. The greatest weakness of the project is that there are simply not enough datapoints for completely robust 
      regressions. However, the data collection is (almost) fully automated, allowing charts to be refreshed each year. Future work 
      should use this data to perform more robust regressions, with more datapoints to improve accuracy.
